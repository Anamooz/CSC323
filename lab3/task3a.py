# Collect the hash value from the webserver

# Break it down to h0, h1, h2, h3, h4

# Input h0 ... h4 to our state machine for the SHA1 algorithm

# Think of a another msg; the extended msg < 512 bits

# Calculate the hash value of the extended msg by calling SHA1

# Send the new hash value to the webserver
